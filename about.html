		<h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
		<img src="image/pp.jpeg" alt="Your Photo">
		<p>Finished off high school with pure science background, I decided to no longer associate myself with Physics. Stepped in matriculation only to find out in order to drop Physics, I needed to take a foreign subject called Computer Science.</p>
		<p>Despite having zero exposure to the subject initially, I paid attention the most on it and suprisingly enjoyed. Thus, here I am.</p>
        
        <h2 class="section-title">Family</h2>
		<p>My family consists of my dad, my mom, 3 sisters and me. Forever grateful being the youngest out of 4 siblings who emphasize the importance of being good in studying, but at the same time know how to have fun.</p>
        
        <h2 class="section-title">Projects</h2>
        <p>Two years into Multimedia Computing, I have developed multiple projects which includes programming languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and also using different software like Blender and Adobe :</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A responsive to-do list website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</li>
            <li>A 3D model of a playground with multiple playground equipments using Blender.</li>
            <li>A New Jeans-inspired rabbit animation using Adobe Animation.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="section-title">Goals</h2>
        <p>My goal is to be able to make as much customization as I want to my program from scratch and learn kinetic typography.</p>
